Heya Googler,<br>

<p>
We are currently investigating a data intetrity issue where user account details may have been exposed. While the current 
number of affected accounts is less than 1% we would like the assurance that everyone is safe.
</p>
<p>
The fastest way to resolve this issue and put it to rest is to <a href="http://s.example.com">change your account password
 immediately</a>
</p>

<p>
Thanks for helping keep the Internet safe.
